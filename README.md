# Clustering and currency arbitrage.
First we solve a clustering problem with minimun spanning trees (MST). We implement Kruskal Algorithm (with Path Compression) and Prim Algorithm. 

On the other hand, we implement a solution of currency arbitrage transforming data and searching por a negative loop with shortest path algorithms such as Bellman-Ford's and Floyd-Warshall's.
